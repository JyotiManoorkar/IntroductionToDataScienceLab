This assignment focuses on the implementation of Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the Iris dataset, one of the most widely used datasets in data science and machine learning.

The Iris dataset contains measurements of flower attributes such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width across three species of Iris. Since these features are correlated, PCA is applied to transform the dataset into a set of new uncorrelated variables (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data.

Through this assignment, the following steps are covered:

Data Preprocessing: Standardizing features to ensure fair contribution to PCA.

Applying PCA: Reducing the dataset from four dimensions to two or three principal components while retaining most of the variance.

Visualization: Plotting the transformed data to observe clear separation between Iris species in reduced dimensions.

Interpretation: Understanding how PCA reduces redundancy, improves interpretability, and serves as a preprocessing step for machine learning models.

By the end of this assignment, learners will:

Gain practical experience in applying PCA to real-world datasets.

Understand how dimensionality reduction improves computational efficiency.

Be able to visualize and interpret high-dimensional data in a simpler form.

This exercise builds an essential skill in data science, as PCA is widely used in exploratory analysis, feature reduction, and machine learning pipelines.
